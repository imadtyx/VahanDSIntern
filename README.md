# VahanDSIntern
The initial assignment given to me for my application to Vahan.ai to test my eligibility.

The goal of the assignment was to extract the names from the image based pdf and add it to a csv. 

The text from the pdf file was first extracted using the Optical Character Recognition.

Since the assignment was done on a jupyter notebook, all of the library and data requirements were handled in the first section. (No extra requirements.txt files)

Just continue pressing `Shift+Enter` from the first cell and anyone shall be good to go:)
